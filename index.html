        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Everyone enjoys playing games in their leisure time. Amongst all the outdoor games, cricket is my favourite and I love to play this game.It is the most watched sport in India and people have an emotional connect towards it.This sport is played by using a bat and a ball between two teams of 11 members each.Every team has its own set of batsmen, bowlers and fielders.My favourite cricketer is Virat Kohli and I love the way he plays the game and leads the entire team.I love to play cricket with my friends, after school, on the playground nearby.My team members always allow me to bat first as I can score runs quickly.My parents have enrolled me to a cricket training centre to motivate and boost my passion in the sport.My aim in life is to become a renowned cricketer and play for the Indian cricket team and represent my nation on the international platform.</p>
